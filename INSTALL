Learn the demo deployment configuration file 'nova_deploy.xml'.
It's really easy to understand.

Modify the configuration according to your needs.

Then type:
  rake deploy
  rake start

And drink a cup of coffee! :D

NOTE: When deploying, you might be asked for password. And be careful when
      starting 'pnode' components, the deploy process will be BLOCKED after
      starting each 'pnode' component, simply press ENTER to keep the process
      going. (Sorry I havn't figured out why it blocks. I'll try to fix this.)

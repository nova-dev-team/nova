About the installer
===================

Installing Nova is a complex process. First, you need to install the master server by running "install.sh", which
downloads required .deb packages by apt-get, installs ruby .gem packages, and compiles utility tools. Then, you will
have to start an FTP (actually, the "storage server" of Nova platform). The next step is to create an installer
package by running "make_allinone_installer.rb" script, which creates an self-contained installer packages for worker
module installation, and pushes it into the FTP storage server. When all those are done, you can simply install a new
worker machine by running "install_worker.rb", or by master module's web interface.

Well, in conclusion, you have to do those:

  1:  ./install.sh
  2:  start an FTP server
  3:  ./make_allinone_installer.rb (you will be asked to provide the FTP server started in step 2)
  4:  install new worker machine by running "./install_worker.rb", or by master module's web interface

About the installer
===================

Installing Nova is a complex process. First, you need to install the master server by running "install.sh", which
downloads required .deb packages by apt-get, installs ruby .gem packages, and compiles utility tools. Then, you will
have to start an FTP (actually, the "storage server" of Nova platform). The next step is to create an installer
package by running "make_allinone_installer.rb" script, which creates an self-contained installer packages for worker
module installation, and pushes it into the FTP storage server. When all those are done, you can simply install a new
worker machine by running "install_worker_by_package.rb", or by master module's web interface.

Well, in conclusion, you have to do those:

  1:  ./install.sh
  2:  start an FTP server
  3:  ./make_allinone_installer.rb (you will be asked to provide the FTP server started in step 2)
  4:  install new worker machine by running "./install_worker_by_package.rb", or by master module's web interface

NOTE: Make sure the machine on which you are makeing the all-in-one installer has same architecture with the target
      machines! For example, all-in-one installer made on amd64 machines could only be used on amd64 machines!


About worker installer scripts
==============================

There are 2 worker installer scripts, "install_worker_by_package.rb" and "install_worker_by_scp.rb", which should be
used under different occasions.

install_worker_by_package.rb:
  We suggest that you use this script for worker machine installation. A very small bootstrap script will be pushed to
  worker machine, and will be triggered on remote worker machine. The script will download the installer from storage
  FTP server, and gets the installation process done.

install_worker_by_scp.rb:
  This script copies all the files to remote worker machine, and runs the 'install.sh'. It does not need the running
  FTP storage server, but requires that every worker machine has Internet connection (for apt-get downloading packages).
  To use this script, you may want to endable forwarding on frontend server.

About the installer
===================

Installing Nova is a complex process. First, you need to install the master server by running "install.sh", which
downloads required .deb packages by apt-get, installs ruby .gem packages, and compiles utility tools. The next step
is to create an installer package by running "make_allinone_installer.rb" script, which creates an self-contained
installer packages for worker module installation. When all those are done, you can simply install a new worker
machine by running "install_worker.rb", or by master module's web interface.

Well, in conclusion, you have to do those:

  1:  ./install.sh
  2:  ./make_allinone_installer.rb
  3:  install new worker machine by running "./install_worker.rb", or by master module's web interface

NOTE: Make sure the machine on which you are makeing the all-in-one installer has same architecture with the target
      machines! For example, all-in-one installer made on amd64 machines could only be used on amd64 machines!

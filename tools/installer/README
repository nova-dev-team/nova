About the installer
===================

Installing Nova is a complex process. However, most of the job could be done
by "install.sh". It will install all required deb/rpm/gem packages, and build
necessary tools, and prepare the Nova database for you. All you need to do is
configuring the system through the web interface.

Well, in conclusion, you have to do those:

  1:  ./install.sh
  2:  configure Nova through the web interface

P.S:  A research environment requires CentOS 5.4 + Xen 3.3.1. We have
      provided a helper script called "install_centos_xen.sh", which will
      install Xen 3.3.1 for you. All you need to do is setting up the
      Grub boot loader.
